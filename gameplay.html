		<blockquote>Gameplay</blockquote>
		<p>Players explore the game's large fantasy world called Teyvat with over 60 different types of characters and various points of interest spread across the map. The game features ad actoin combat playstyle that allows the player to swap between 4 individual characters in a party to quickly combo attack. Single-player gameplay is the focus of the game, with Co-Op Mode available for certain activities.</p>
		<p>Each character has two unique combat skills: an Elemental Skill and an Elemental Burst. The Elemental Skill can be used at any time except for the cooldown period immediately after use, while the Elemental Burst has an Energy Cost, requiring the user to amass sufficient Energy first.</p>
		<p>Characters have cotrol over one of seven natural elements: Anemo, Cryo, Dendro, Electro, Geo, Hydro, and Pyro. Combining these elements using Elemental Reactions is encouraged to quickly defeat enemies such as the strongest ones in game, Vaporize (Hydro + Pyro) and Melt (Cryo + Pyro).</p>
		<p>Players can venture inside Domains, which are temple-like structures scattered across the map, to complete the challenges within and obtain either one-time rewards or certain materials required for character development. Once characters are properly geared, players can choose to enter the Spiral Abyss, a special type of Domain cnosisting of different floors of combat chalenges.</p>
		<p>Cooking and crafting are other significant aspect of Genshin Impact's gameplay. Players gather many resources in the course of their adventure, some of which can be turned into dishes via cooking, including potions and Character Development Items via crafting. Dishes can regenerate characters' health (HP), boost attack or defensive abilities, and decrease stamina consumption, while potions can increase a characters resistance against an element.</p>
		<p>Further progression in the game unlocks the Housing system, known as the Serenitea Pot, in which players can create furnishings and place them in a realm layout, gaining access to rewards and level-up materials.</p>
		<p>The Fishing system allows players to catch fish, which can be displayed in the Serenitea Pot, exchanged at each nation's Fishing Association for rewards, or processed into fish as a cooking ingredient.</p>
