		<blockquote>Storyline</blockquote>
		<h2>Archon Quests</h2>
			<p>The Archon Quests are the main focus of the story, for it includes the Traveler (you) and your companion, Paimon on the journey to meet the Seven Archons in hopes to find the God that had taken away your sibling in the beginning of the game. These quests have you visit each region and Archon that rules, starting off with Mondstadt and their God of Anemo, Venti, then venturing into Liyue, and their God of Geo, Zhongli, then going to Inazuma and their Goddess of Electro, the Raiden Shogun, and lastly (that is at least out in the current moment) Sumeru and their Goddess of Wisdom, Nahida. The Traveler and Paimon explore each region and also help with the problems that each nation ends up facing.</p>
			<p>Going on, these quests also contain important quests with a character named, Dainsleif, a Bough Keeper from Khaenri'ah, the fallen nation that was destroyed by Celestia 500 years ago. Along these quests, Dainsleif pulls you off to the side in hopes to find more information about your sibling and the Abyss - the enemy.</p>
		<h2>Story Quests</h2>
			<p>Story Quests are basically side quests that you can unlock with keys that you can obtain after doing 8 commissions. These quests contain side / backstories of the beloved playable 5 star characters that are in the game. These also include Hangout Events, which are interactive hang out stories that you can go with a limited amount of the playable 4 star characters.</p>
		<h2>World Quests</h2>
			<p>World Quests are unlocked by speaking to NPCs throughout Teyvat. They're basically side quests you can do to gain insight of various locations and stories of the world. They're usually not important to the main story, for it does not add any effect to the storyline or the world.</p>
		<h2>Commissions</h2>
			<p>Commissions are daily quests that players can complete to get rewards, but some have stories tied to them and cannot be accessable if you haven't gotten through a certain part of the story.</p>
